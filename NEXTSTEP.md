Build basic layout + css for

- DONE body (set background color, flex column align items center, overflow clip)
- DONE App -- child of body (set width as function of breakpoint, height to screen height, overflow clip)
- DONE Header -- child of app...copy from old app
- DONE picker -- take from bot's generated code...simplify as much as possible
- DONE Viz container -- empty for now...width 100%, height set to fill all remaining space, overflow clip
